                            <br><b>1.</b> In his internship at TRDDC Pune, Saubhik got the opportunity to work at Legal Document Classification problem, where the documents needed to be classified into 300+ subcategories. He worked in a group of 5, to develop algorithms for this multi-class multi-label classification problem. He wrote codes for implementation of proposed algorithms, and was able to achieve an average precision of 0.761. 
                            <br>Language Used : Python
                            <br>Tools used : Jupyter Notebook
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>2.</b> As a Computer Architecture course project under Dr. Jimson Mathew, he implemented a two-pass assembler and emulator for a given Assembly Language. The assembler would check for errors or warnings in the first code,store addresses for different pnemonics and lables, and in second pass, would generate a Machine language file where each instruction would be of 32 bits. The emulator would run over the object file , and execute the program line by line.
                            <br>Language Used : C++
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <b>3.</b> As a Secure System Design course project under Dr. Samrat Mondal, he developed a system that can detect password breaches of a login system, and inform the server , and also shutdown if the breach continues. It is based over HoneyWord Based Password Cracking Detection , proposed by Imran Erguler. 
                            <br>Language Used : C
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <b>4.</b> As a self project , he developed an Android App that can conduct an Online Examination by streaming the audio and video of a candidate to a remote server, and saving the same over the server. This app is capable of reducing malpractice that happens during online examination since video as well as audio activity is continuosly monitored and saved.
